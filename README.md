This project is a Node.js / Express REST API that generates PDF invoices and waybills alongside companion Excel files (.xlsx) based on structured JSON input for importing data into the "Jumis" accounting system.
The API is designed to act as a backend automation worker: you send it normalized invoice data, and it returns ready-to-use accounting documents that are consistent and localized (Latvian).
The service is particularly designed to integrate with workflow automation platforms like Make.com or Zapier, where incoming emails → parsed JSON → API call → resulting PDF + Excel files can all happen without manual intervention.
